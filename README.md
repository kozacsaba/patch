# Patch
simple lightweight vst plugin for custom inter-plugin routing

# Why
Many DAWs do not allow audio rooting that could result in feedback. This plugin
aims to make that possible, as well as serve as a proof of concept for future
applications

# Features
* add routing links in the form of a list
* allow optional, adjustable delay specified in either ms or samples
* add option to correct for process-block-delay
* safe mode / overdrive prevention (clip / stop / off)
* adjustable gain

# Disclaimer
All the above are then plans for the project, not its current state
